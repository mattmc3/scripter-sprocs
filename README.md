# sqlgen-procs

Have you ever wished Microsoft would just ship stored procs that generated SQL
for you? Have you used SQL DMO and thought it was painfully slow? Yeah... me
too.

## goals

My goals for this project are simple:

1. Provide a simple way to generate SQL from SQL

2. Become either the de-facto way to do that, or have Microsoft integrate these scripts into SQL Server itself.
